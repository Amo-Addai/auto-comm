Subject: Backing the Future of Institutional Investing in Africa — CoFund ($5M Pre-Seed) - Pitch Deck - Book a 30min Meet on my Calendar



⸻



Hi ,



I’m reaching out to share an opportunity at the intersection of fintech, infrastructure, and institutional capital — a space that’s increasingly critical but vastly underserved in emerging markets.



CoFund is a digital-first investment platform that simplifies how institutional capital flows into large-scale, high-impact projects across Africa. We’re building the infrastructure to let VCs, PE firms, family offices, and mutual funds structure, deploy, and manage co-investments with the same speed and transparency they expect in developed markets.



⸻



🚀 What we’re solving:



Despite trillions in dry powder, institutional investors face fragmented deal flow, manual fund structuring, and no transparent way to co-invest into high-growth frontier projects.

CoFund changes that — through a unified SaaS platform with:



    •    Project fund structuring & syndicate tools

    •    Curated, ESG-qualified deal marketplace

    •    Real-time risk scoring, capital monitoring & return forecasting

    •    End-to-end compliance rails (KYC, AML, BOG/SEC-grade)



⸻



📊 Why now:



    •    Rising demand for sustainable investments in emerging markets

    •    Explosive growth in Africa’s infrastructure & energy projects

    •    Institutional appetite for digitally-native fund infrastructure



We’re launching in Ghana, backed by support from ecosystem players like MEST Africa, KIC, and leading regional syndicates. Our 3-year goal is to process $1B+ in managed capital across 100+ institutional clients.



⸻



💰 What we’re raising:



We’re currently raising $5M in Pre-Seed, structured as a convertible note ($20M cap, 20% discount), to:



    •    Finalize MVP and full product modules

    •    Secure regulatory integrations & partnerships

    •    Launch with 5 anchor clients and scale across the region



⸻



I’d love to share our deck and vision further — would you be open to a quick call next week?
