Subject:Â Backing the Future of Institutional Investing in Africa â€” CoFund ($5M Pre-Seed)Â - Pitch DeckÂ -Â  Book a 30min Meet on my Calendar

â¸»

HiÂ [First Name],

Iâ€™m reaching out to share an opportunity at the intersection of fintech, infrastructure, and institutional capital â€” a space thatâ€™s increasingly critical but vastly underserved in emerging markets.

CoFundÂ is a digital-first investment platform that simplifies how institutional capital flows into large-scale, high-impact projects across Africa. Weâ€™re building the infrastructure to let VCs, PE firms, family offices, and mutual fundsÂ structure, deploy, and manageÂ co-investments with the same speed and transparency they expect in developed markets.

â¸»

ðŸš€Â What weâ€™re solving:

Despite trillions in dry powder, institutional investors faceÂ fragmented deal flow,Â manual fund structuring, andÂ no transparent way to co-invest into high-growth frontier projects.
CoFund changes that â€” through a unified SaaS platform with:

Â  Â  â€¢ Â  Â Project fund structuring & syndicate tools
Â  Â  â€¢ Â  Â Curated, ESG-qualified deal marketplace
Â  Â  â€¢ Â  Â Real-time risk scoring, capital monitoring & return forecasting
Â  Â  â€¢ Â  Â End-to-end compliance rails (KYC, AML, BOG/SEC-grade)

â¸»

ðŸ“ŠÂ Why now:

Â  Â  â€¢ Â  Â Rising demand forÂ sustainable investmentsÂ in emerging markets
Â  Â  â€¢ Â  Â Explosive growth inÂ Africaâ€™s infrastructure & energy projects
Â  Â  â€¢ Â  Â Institutional appetite forÂ digitally-native fund infrastructure

Weâ€™re launching in Ghana, backed by support from ecosystem players like MEST Africa, KIC, and leading regional syndicates. Our 3-year goal is to processÂ $1B+ in managed capitalÂ across 100+ institutional clients.

â¸»

ðŸ’°Â What weâ€™re raising:

Weâ€™re currently raisingÂ $5M in Pre-Seed, structured as a convertible note ($20M cap, 20% discount), to:

Â  Â  â€¢ Â  Â Finalize MVP and full product modules
Â  Â  â€¢ Â  Â Secure regulatory integrations & partnerships
Â  Â  â€¢ Â  Â Launch with 5 anchor clients and scale across the region
